## I. Source and Data Acknowledgement 

This case study is based on the historical data and analysis presented in “How Data Storytelling Could Save Lives – The Case Study of Ignaz Semmelweis” published by DataCamp. The presented dataset, visualizations, and analytics are publicly available through DataCamp and Kaggle and have been widely used as an instructional example of how data can influence real-world decision-making.

For this case study, I did not recreate or simulate the dataset, nor did I redesign the original visualizations. Instead, I directly used the existing dataset and charts provided in the source materials and focuseed on interpreting the graphs, persuading a narrative, and extracting insights through a data storytelling perspective. A Jupyter Notebook containing the original analysis and visualizations is included as supporting material to demonstrate transparency.
Organizational Context

In the mid-19th century, hospitals across Europe faced dangerously high maternal mortality rates due to childbed fever. However, two maternity clinics at Vienna General Hospital had significantly differing death rates. The doctors at the time lacked the analytical skills and cultural awareness necessary to figure out the cause of such difference. Meanwhile, Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis started gathering and analyzing mortality data between the two clinics and eventually found that one of the main causes of infection was poor hygiene, notably doctors not washing their hands after performing autopsies.

This argument is particularly rationale not only because of the discovery but also because of its data storytelling perspective in bringing a signigficant change. Semmelweis found it difficult to persuade his colleagues, despite the fact that the data strongly demonstrated a significant drop in death rates following the introduction of handwashing. The numbers were there, but the narrative was not successfully presented in a manner consistent with the attitudes, motivations, and culture of the medical establishment at the time. This case, perhaps, is one of the first and most significant instances of how data may have a direct impact on people's lives when it is presented and communicated effectively . This also depicts the consequence of not turning facts into a convincing story that decision-makers would embrace.

## Communication Goals
The goal of this case study is to show how data storytelling can fill  the gap between evidence and action. Using the Semmelweis dataset and its associated visualizations, this case study examines how simple comparative charts, when combined with the right narrative, can challenge assumptions, depicts causal relationships, and drive behavioral change.
Rather than focusing on advanced analytics, this case emphasizes clarity, contrast, and timing in communication. The objective is to highlights the importance of evidence based narrative through an effective data storytelling in influencing policy, professional practice, and organizational culture.

## Audience
This case study can be useful to Healthcare executives, public health experts, legislators, and organizational leaders who depend on statistics to make executive decision. It is also very useful for managers, students, and data analysts who want to know why compelling evidence isn't always sufficient and how narrative can influence whether data inspires resistance or action.

## Key Story Elements

This case study follows a classic data storytelling structure:
Context: High maternal mortality rates with no c;lear explanation.


Conflict: Two clinics with significamtly different results and resistance from medical professionals.


Evidence: Data showing mortality rates before and after the introduction of handwashing.


Insight: Relationship between hygiene practices and survival.


Outcome: Delayed adoption due to poor communication, lack of data driven narratives and cultural resistance.


Lesson: Data must be conveyed as a strong narrative/storyto drive change.

## Data and Visualization
The visualizations used in this case study were taken directly from the DataCamp and Kaggle materials associated with the Semmelweis dataset. These charts include comparisons of mortality rates across clinics and timelines showing changes before and after handwashing policies were introduced.
While the visuals themselves were not redesigned, the interpretation of these data  here is original. The focus is on how visual contrast and trends made the findings clear, even with limited statistical tools. This reinstates the idea that effective data storytelling does not depend on complex data models, but on selecting the right visuals and framing them within a rationale  narrative.

Visualization 1 — Total Deaths by Clinic

Question:
Which clinics report the highest total number of deaths?

Insight:
The visualization shows that deaths are not evenly distributed across clinics. A small number of clinics account for a disproportionately high number of deaths, indicating concentrated operational or care-quality risks.

Visualization 2 — Identification of High-Risk Clinics (“Alarming Numbers”)

Question:
Which clinics stand out as outliers with unusually high mortality compared to peers?

Insight:
A few clinics clearly exceed others in mortality counts, marking them as high-risk facilities. These outliers suggest areas where immediate investigation and intervention may be required.

Visualization 3 — Distribution of Deaths Across Clinics

Question:
How are deaths distributed across all clinics?

Insight:
The distribution is highly skewed, with most clinics reporting relatively low counts while a small number experience significantly higher mortality. This pattern highlights systemic inequality in outcomes across facilities.

Visualization 4 — Cumulative Share of Deaths by Clinic (Concentration Analysis)

Question:
Do a small number of clinics account for the majority of total deaths?

Insight:
The cumulative analysis shows that a limited subset of clinics contributes a large share of total deaths, reinforcing the presence of concentration effects similar to a Pareto distribution.

Visualization 5 — Comparison of High- vs Low-Mortality Clinics

Question:
How do high-mortality clinics compare to lower-mortality clinics in overall contribution to deaths?

Insight:
High-mortality clinics contribute disproportionately to total deaths despite representing a small fraction of all facilities. This suggests that targeted interventions could yield significant overall improvement.

Visualization 6 — Relative Mortality Contribution by Clinic Tier

Question:
How does mortality contribution change when clinics are grouped into tiers based on death counts?

Insight:
When clinics are grouped into tiers, the highest tier dominates total mortality, while lower tiers contribute marginally. This reinforces the importance of prioritizing oversight on top-tier risk facilities.

Visualization 7 — Mortality Concentration Summary

Question:
What overall pattern emerges when examining mortality concentration across clinics?

Insight:
Across all visualizations, mortality consistently appears concentrated rather than evenly spread. This indicates that system-wide averages mask critical localized risks that require focused management attention
