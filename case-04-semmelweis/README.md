## 5. Sequence of Visualizations
- Line chart of mortality rates (before and after intervention)  
- Annotated break point showing the change  
- Difference summary (bar or text callout)  

---

## 6. Raw Data
The original dataset has been reconstructed in GitHub teaching repositories and DataCamp projects.  
If unavailable, simulate monthly mortality rates before/after intervention (e.g., 18% → 3%).

## Notes for Repository
- Save this README.md inside `case-04-semmelweis/`.  
- Add `visuals/` with line chart + annotation.  
- Add `data/` with mortality data (real or simulated).
