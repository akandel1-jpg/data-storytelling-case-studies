## 1. Business Context
This article introduces data storytelling as the intersection of **data, narrative, and visuals**.  
It highlights how organizations can present data in a way that influences decision-making and drives business impact.  
The framework is relevant for any company that wants to turn analysis into action.

## 2. Communication Goal
Teach managers and analysts how to move beyond static reports and use **story-driven data presentations** to persuade stakeholders and inform decisions.

## 3. Audience
- Business executives and leaders  
- Product and marketing managers  
- Data analysts / BI professionals  

---

## 4. Narrative Structure
The article emphasizes blending three elements — **data + visuals + narrative**.  
Typical structure:
1. Setup: Define the business question.  
2. Analysis: Present data directly tied to that question.  
3. Persuasion: Combine visuals with narrative to engage.  
4. Decision: Conclude with actionable recommendations.

## 5. Sequence of Visualizations
- **High-level KPI chart (bar/line):** Show overall trend.  
- **Segment comparison (stacked bar/grouped chart):** Break down performance across categories.  
- **Action-oriented chart (before/after or forecast band):** Connect the data story to the decision.

## 6. Raw Data
The article does not provide raw data.  
For practice, you can pair this storytelling framework with:  
- Open sales dataset (Kaggle: retail sales, marketing campaigns)  
- Or simulate simple data (e.g., monthly revenue by segment).
