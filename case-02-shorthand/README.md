## 1. Business Context
One of the most thorough and data-rich reports on the state of world health is the World Health Organization's (WHO) World Health Statistics 2024 report. It displays thousands of data points for over a hundred variables, ranging from environmental health and universal healthcare to child mortality, disease incidence, and labor shortages. The study transforms complex statistics into meaningful, human-centered insights on how the world is performing in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being) by combining extensive statistical databases with powerful visualizations.
However, it is practically difficult to include every aspect in a single analysis when dealing with such an enormous amount of data. As a result, I purposefully chose seven crucial visualizations for this case study that together provide a cogent, cross-sectional narrative of humanity's health journey, from workforce capacity and healthcare systems to mortality and disease control. Each figure was selected not just for its analytical significance but also for its capacity to convey urgency, progress, and disparity in a way that is not possible with just raw statistics.
This choice exemplifies a narrative approach to data analysis: turning a sea of data into a coherent story that can captivate readers and decision-makers. Instead of presenting each graph or figure, this case study focuses on the figures that best demonstrate the power of data storytelling — how visualization and narrative together can inform global priorities and inspire action.

## 2. Communication Goal
The communication goal of this case study is to translate data from WHO’s statistical report into a structured, meaningful narrative that connects evidence to strategy. Through visual storytelling, the analysis aims to show where the world health succeeded and struggled, and the strategic action to close the gap. The purpose is not only to display what the numbers reveal, but to communicate why they matter to health planners, policymakers, and ordinary people whose well-being depends on these outcomes. By analyzing visual data from 1990 to 2030 across several dimensions, this study converts static information into actionable insight.

## 3. Audience
-This case study covers a wide range of audiences who rely on evidence-based insight to understand global health trends. This includes policy analysts and development leaders who use WHO data to guide decisions on funding, programs, and long-term planning. It's also useful for public health professionals and NGO to identify the gap in the healthcare system and make informed decisions to fill that gap. At the academic level, the analysis is useful for researchers, students, and data storytellers learning how to integrate large datasets into actionable narratives. This is also useful for general readers and advocates who want to understand the complex evolving trend in global health through easy visualization.

## 4. Narrative Structure
Context: The WHO World Health Statistics report provides decades of global data on mortality, disease burden, health systems, and progress toward SDG 3. This context establishes why the data matters and frames the global challenges, such as child mortality, infectious diseases, injuries, and health workforce shortages.


Conflict: The visualizations depict persistent inequalities between regions, slowing progress in key disease areas, workforce shortages, and uneven advancement toward the Triple Billion targets. These disparities represent the central tension in the data story. It shows unequal and slow progress across populations.


Resolution: The selected charts highlight pathways to improvement, including stronger maternal and child health programs, reinvestment in preventive measures, building a dedicated health workforce, and adopting best practices from top-performing regions. The data points toward actionable steps countries can take to accelerate progress toward the 2030 goals.

## 5. Sequence of Visualizations
Unlike Case Study 1, where I worked directly with raw data and created my own charts in Python, the visualizations for this case study were not developed or coded by me. Instead, they come directly from the World Health Statistics 2024 report, which already contains an enormous collection of professionally designed charts. My role here was to carefully review, extract, and analyze the visuals that best represent the global health story I wanted to tell. Because WHO’s graphics are already rich with regional comparisons, timelines, and clear color coding, my part was to interpret what those visuals reveal, connect them to broader themes, and explain why they matter. In this sense, the visualization process was less about technical development and more about selecting meaningful figures, understanding the narrative behind them, and communicating their insights in a clear way to the audience.

5. Visualizations & Analytical Questions
Visualization 1 — Injury-Related Deaths by Type, Gender, and Region

Question:
How do injury-related death rates vary across injury types, gender, and WHO regions, and how have these patterns changed over time?

Insight:
The visualization shows clear regional and gender disparities in injury-related deaths, with certain injury types disproportionately affecting specific populations. While overall rates decline in some regions, others show slower improvement, highlighting uneven progress in injury prevention and safety interventions.

Visualization 2 — Global Malaria Incidence Trend (2000–2023)

Question:
What long-term trend does global malaria incidence follow, and are there periods where progress slows or reverses?

Insight:
Malaria incidence declines steadily in the early 2000s but plateaus in later years, indicating that initial intervention gains have slowed. This suggests diminishing returns from existing strategies and the need for renewed or targeted prevention efforts.

Visualization 3 — Population Requiring Intervention for Neglected Tropical Diseases

Question:
Which WHO regions account for the largest share of people needing intervention for neglected tropical diseases relative to population size?

Insight:
A small number of regions carry a disproportionately high disease burden, showing that global averages mask severe regional inequalities. Targeted interventions in these regions would yield the greatest impact.

Visualization 4 — Progress Toward WHO Triple Billion Targets

Question:
How much progress has been achieved toward the WHO Triple Billion targets, and which indicators contribute most to overall gains?

Insight:
The visualization indicates uneven progress across the three targets, with some areas advancing faster than others. This imbalance suggests that gains in one health dimension do not automatically translate into comprehensive system improvement.

Visualization 5 — Global Health Workforce Shortage by Region

Question:
How is the health workforce shortage distributed across WHO regions, and how is it expected to evolve by 2030?

Insight:
Workforce shortages are concentrated in regions with the highest health burdens, and projections show these gaps widening over time. This misalignment poses a major risk to sustaining health improvements without significant investment in human resources.

Visualization 6 — Gap to Best-Performing Countries by 2030

Question:
What level of improvement is required for countries to match top performers across health coverage, population health, and emergency preparedness indicators?

Insight:
The visualization highlights substantial gaps between current performance and achievable benchmarks, demonstrating that incremental change is insufficient. Accelerated, system-wide improvements are necessary to close these gaps by 2030.

Visualization 7 — Child and Neonatal Mortality Trends by Region (1990–2023)

Question:
How have child and neonatal mortality rates changed across regions, and which regions show the fastest and slowest progress?

Insight:
Although mortality rates decline globally, the pace of improvement varies widely across regions. Some regions show rapid progress, while others lag significantly, underscoring persistent inequality in child health outcomes.
